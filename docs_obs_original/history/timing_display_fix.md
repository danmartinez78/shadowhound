# Timing Display Fix

## Purpose
Preserve historical context while signaling that this page requires verification against the current workflow.

## Prerequisites
- Review the legacy notes below to understand original assumptions and instructions.
- Cross-check commands and links with the latest tooling before execution.

## Steps
1. Read through the legacy notes captured under **Legacy Notes** and flag outdated guidance.
2. Update or replace the content with validated procedures as time permits.
3. Record verification outcomes in the validation checklist and mark follow-up tasks in the backlog.

### Legacy Notes
**Date**: October 7, 2025  
**Commit**: `0c106cd`  
**Issue**: Timing diagnostics overwriting commands and responses in terminal

---

## 🐛 Problem

Timing information was being broadcast as **separate messages**, causing:
- Terminal clutter with multiple broadcast calls
- Duplicate entries (broadcast_sync + add_terminal_line)
- Timing appearing as separate line that could overwrite previous content
- Harder to read command → response → timing flow

**Before (CLUTTERED)**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ TERMINAL                                                    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ [14:32:15] > take one step forward                         │
│ [14:32:17] ✅ Robot moved forward successfully             │
│ [14:32:17] ⏱️  TIMING: Agent 1.23s | Overhead 0.045s...    │ ← Separate!
│ [14:32:17] ⏱️  TIMING: Agent 1.23s | Overhead 0.045s...    │ ← Duplicate!
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Code causing duplication**:
```python
# Three separate calls!
self.web.broadcast_sync(f"✅ {response_preview}")  # Call 1
self.web.broadcast_sync(timing_msg)                # Call 2
self.web.add_terminal_line(timing_msg)             # Call 3 (duplicate!)
```

---

## ✅ Solution

Combined response and timing into **single message** with newline separator:

**After (CLEAN)**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ TERMINAL                                                    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ [14:32:15] > take one step forward                         │
│ [14:32:17] ✅ Robot moved forward successfully             │
│             ⏱️  Agent 1.23s | Overhead 0.045s | Total 1.28s │ ← Clean!
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**New code (single call)**:
```python
# One combined message!
combined_msg = (
    f"✅ {response_preview}\n"
    f"⏱️  Agent {timing_info['agent_duration']:.2f}s | "
    f"Overhead {timing_info['overhead_duration']:.3f}s | "
    f"Total {timing_info['total_duration']:.2f}s"
)
self.web.broadcast_sync(combined_msg)  # Single call
```

## 📊 Changes Made

### Files Modified
- `mission_agent.py`: Combined response + timing messages

### Lines Changed
- **Before**: 18 lines (duplicate broadcasts)
- **After**: 16 lines (-2 lines)
- **Removed**: Duplicate `add_terminal_line()` calls
- **Removed**: Separate timing broadcast

### Benefits
✅ Cleaner terminal output
✅ No duplicate messages
✅ Timing appears with response (not separate)
✅ Easier to read command flow
✅ Performance panel still updates (unchanged)

---

## 🔍 Technical Details

### What Changed

**_execute_mission_from_web()** (Line ~213):
```python
# Before
self.web.broadcast_sync(f"✅ {response_preview}")
self.web.broadcast_sync(timing_msg)
self.web.add_terminal_line(timing_msg)

# After
combined_msg = f"✅ {response_preview}\n⏱️  Agent {duration}s..."
self.web.broadcast_sync(combined_msg)
```

**mission_callback()** (Line ~268):
```python
# Before
self.web.broadcast_sync(f"✅ {response_preview}")
self.web.broadcast_sync(timing_msg)
self.web.add_terminal_line(timing_msg)

# After
combined_msg = f"✅ {response_preview}\n⏱️  Agent {duration}s..."
self.web.broadcast_sync(combined_msg)
```

### What Stayed the Same

✅ Performance metrics panel (still updates via `update_performance_metrics()`)
✅ ROS logging (still logs timing breakdown)
✅ Timing data structure (unchanged)
✅ All timing calculations (unchanged)

## 🧪 Expected Output

### In Web UI Terminal

**Command via Web UI**:
```
[14:32:15] > take one step forward
[14:32:17] ✅ Robot moved forward successfully
            ⏱️  Agent 1.23s | Overhead 0.045s | Total 1.28s
```

**Command via ROS Topic**:
```
[14:35:20] > rotate right and step back
[14:35:24] ✅ Robot rotated 90 degrees, then stepped backward
            ⏱️  Agent 3.82s | Overhead 0.089s | Total 3.90s
```

### In ROS Logs (Unchanged)

```
[INFO] [mission_agent]: 📨 Received mission command: take one step forward
[INFO] [mission_executor]: Executing mission: take one step forward
[INFO] [mission_executor]: ⏱️  Timing breakdown:
[INFO] [mission_executor]:    Agent call: 1.23s (96%)
[INFO] [mission_executor]:    Overhead:   0.045s
[INFO] [mission_executor]:    Total:      1.28s
[INFO] [mission_agent]: ✅ Mission completed: Robot moved forward...
```

### In Performance Panel (Unchanged)

```
⚡ PERFORMANCE METRICS
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ AGENT CALL      1.23s    🟢    │
│ OVERHEAD        0.045s   🟢    │
│ TOTAL TIME      1.28s    🟢    │
│ COMMANDS        42              │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 🎯 User Experience Improvement

### Before (Cluttered)
```
Terminal scroll:
> command
✅ success
⏱️ timing        ← Separate line
⏱️ timing        ← DUPLICATE!
> next command
```

**Issues**:
- ❌ Duplicates confusing
- ❌ Hard to see command → result flow
- ❌ Timing feels disconnected
- ❌ Extra scrolling needed

### After (Clean)
```
Terminal scroll:
> command
✅ success
⏱️ timing        ← Part of response block
> next command
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ One timing line per command
- ✅ Clear command → result → timing flow
- ✅ Timing visually grouped with response
- ✅ Less scrolling, easier to read

---

## 🚀 Testing

### Verify the Fix

1. **Launch system**:
   ```bash
   source install/setup.bash
   ros2 launch shadowhound_bringup shadowhound.launch.py
   ```

2. **Open web UI**: http://localhost:8080

3. **Send test command**:
   ```bash
   ros2 topic pub /mission_command std_msgs/String \
       "data: 'stand up'" --once
   ```

4. **Check terminal**:
   - ✅ Should see response + timing as one block
   - ✅ No duplicate timing lines
   - ✅ Clean, readable output

5. **Check performance panel**:
   - ✅ Still updates with latest timing
   - ✅ Averages still calculate correctly

---

## 📝 Summary

**Problem**: Timing messages cluttering terminal with duplicates  
**Solution**: Combine response + timing into single message  
**Result**: Clean, readable terminal output  
**Impact**: Better UX, easier to follow command execution  

**Commit**: `0c106cd`  
**Status**: ✅ Pushed to origin/feature/dimos-integration
