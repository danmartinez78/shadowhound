# ShadowHound Development Roadmap

## Purpose
Preserve historical context while signaling that this page requires verification against the current workflow.

## Prerequisites
- Review the legacy notes below to understand original assumptions and instructions.
- Cross-check commands and links with the latest tooling before execution.

## Steps
1. Read through the legacy notes captured under **Legacy Notes** and flag outdated guidance.
2. Update or replace the content with validated procedures as time permits.
3. Record verification outcomes in the validation checklist and mark follow-up tasks in the backlog.

### Legacy Notes
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-08  
**Branch**: dev

This document tracks planned features, investigations, and improvements for the ShadowHound project.

## 🔴 Critical Issues

### ROS Logging Warning Investigation
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Status**: 🔍 Investigating

```
[WARN] [rcl.logging_rosout]: Publisher already registered for provided node name.
If this is due to multiple nodes with the same name then all logs for that 
logger name will go out over the existing publisher. As soon as any node with 
that name is destructed it will unregister the publisher, preventing any further 
logs for that name from being published on the rosout topic.
```

**Context**: Appears during system startup. May indicate node name collision or lifecycle issue.

**Investigation Steps**:
- [ ] Identify which node(s) trigger the warning
- [ ] Check for duplicate node names in launch files
- [ ] Review node lifecycle initialization order
- [ ] Verify ROS logging configuration

### WebRTC Skills + Nav2 Interference
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Status**: 🔍 Investigating

**Problem**: 
- WebRTC skills (sit, stand) only work via CLI `ros2 topic pub`
- CLI publishing of WebRTC skills breaks Nav2 skills (including teleop)
- Joynode allows translation/rotation AND sit/stand without breaking either

**Hypothesis**: Potential command multiplexing or priority issue in the Unitree SDK bridge.

**Investigation Steps**:
- [ ] Analyze joynode implementation (how does it multiplex commands?)
- [ ] Review Unitree SDK bridge for command queue/priority handling
- [ ] Check if WebRTC and Nav2 commands use conflicting interfaces
- [ ] Test if issue is timing-related or architectural
- [ ] Consider implementing command arbiter pattern similar to joynode

**References**:
- Joynode allows both command types simultaneously without conflicts
- May need to implement proper command multiplexing layer
