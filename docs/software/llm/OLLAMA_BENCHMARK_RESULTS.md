## Detailed Results

### ✅ qwen2.5-coder:32b - PRODUCTION MODEL

**Overall Performance**:
- **Quality**: 98.0/100 (best)
- **Speed**: 4.4 tok/s (slowest working model)
- **Memory**: ~20GB

**Performance by Task**:
- **Navigation (JSON)**: Excellent - Properly formatted JSON with correct structure
- **Simple prompts**: Excellent - Concise, correct responses
- **Reasoning**: Good - Logical explanations

**Why This Won**:
1. **JSON specialist** - Training on code corpus → perfect for navigation plans
2. **Consistent quality** - High scores across all task types

### ⚠️ qwq:32b - LOW QUALITY (UNEXPECTED)

**Overall Performance**:
- **Quality**: 40.0/100 (poor)
- **Speed**: 9.5 tok/s (reasonable)
- **Memory**: ~20GB

**Why Quality Scored Low**:
1. **Verbose reasoning chains**: Outputs long "let me think..." explanations
2. **Quality scorer mismatch**: Expects concise answers, penalizes verbosity
3. **JSON buried in text**: Valid JSON exists but wrapped in reasoning

**Example Output Pattern** (hypothesis):
```
Let me think through this step by step...

First, I need to consider the robot's dimensions: 0.6m wide.
The doorway is 0.8m wide, providing 0.2m total clearance.
The obstacle is positioned 0.3m to the left of center...

After careful analysis, here's the JSON plan:
{"steps": [...]}

Therefore, the robot should pass on the right side because...
```

**Quality Scorer Problem**:
- Looks for JSON at start of response
- Penalizes extra text
- Reasoning models optimized for explanation, not conciseness

**Recommendation**: ❌ **NOT SUITABLE** for current use case

**Future Consideration**: 
- Could work with modified quality scorer (extract JSON from text)
- Could work with prompts that emphasize "JSON only, no explanation"
- May be useful for complex reasoning tasks (not navigation)

### ❌ llama3.3:70b - FAILED (MEMORY EXHAUSTION)

**Status**: Did not complete benchmark  
**Speed**: 0.0 tok/s  
**Quality**: 18.7/100 (default for failures)

**Probable Cause**: **Memory Exhaustion**

**Analysis**:
- **Model size**: 43GB
- **Thor's RAM**: 128GB total
- **Other services**: ROS2 (~15GB) + Nav2 (~10GB) + System (~20GB) + Ollama (~5GB) = ~50GB
- **Available**: ~78GB at test time
- **Conclusion**: Should fit, but memory pressure likely

**Evidence**:
1. Baseline llama3.1:70b worked (similar size, 70.6B params)
2. llama3.3 is newer model, may have different memory requirements
3. Could be quantization differences (Q4 vs Q8)

**Potential Fixes**:
1. Stop unnecessary services before benchmark
2. Check actual memory usage: `docker stats ollama`
3. Try smaller quantization: `llama3.3:70b-q4` instead of default
4. Increase timeout beyond 120s (model load might be slow)

**Recommendation**: ❌ **INVESTIGATION NEEDED** before production use

---

### ❌ deepseek-r1:7b - FAILED (UNKNOWN)

**Status**: Did not complete benchmark  
**Speed**: 0.0 tok/s  
**Quality**: 18.7/100 (default for failures)

**Probable Cause**: **Unknown** (should work with only 5GB)

**Analysis**:
- **Model size**: 4.7GB (smallest tested)
- **Memory**: Should easily fit
- **Popularity**: 65.2M pulls (massive, should be stable)
- **Conclusion**: Likely not memory-related

**Possible Causes**:
1. **Model pull incomplete**: Corrupted download
2. **Ollama version incompatibility**: deepseek-r1 is very new (Jan 2025)
3. **Timeout**: Reasoning models can be slow on first token
4. **Network issue**: Download failed silently

**Debug Steps** (for future investigation):
```bash
# Check if model exists
docker exec ollama ollama list | grep deepseek-r1

# Try manual run
docker exec ollama ollama run deepseek-r1:7b "Say hello"

# Check Ollama logs
docker logs ollama | grep -i deepseek

# Re-pull model
docker exec ollama ollama pull deepseek-r1:7b --force
```

**Recommendation**: ❌ **NOT RELIABLE** - skip for now

## Lessons Learned

### 1. **Specialization Wins**
- qwen2.5-coder (JSON specialist) beat larger general models
- Task-specific training > model size for narrow domains

### 2. **Quality > Speed for Planning**
- 4.4 tok/s is acceptable for mission planning
- Humans take seconds to decide, robots can too
- Real-time control uses reactive systems, not LLMs

### 3. **Reasoning Models Need Different Evaluation**
- qwq failed quality checks due to verbosity
- Current scorer optimized for concise answers
- Reasoning chains valuable for debugging, not production

### 4. **Memory Matters**
- llama3.3:70b failure likely memory-related
- Need headroom for other services
- 32B models (20GB) safer than 70B (43GB)

### 5. **Small Models Competitive**
- phi4:14b (9GB) achieved 86.7/100 quality
- 2024-2025 small models dramatically improved
- Good enough for many tasks

## Future Work

### Investigation Tasks
1. **Debug llama3.3:70b** - Should work, need to identify failure mode
2. **Debug deepseek-r1:7b** - Popular model, worth fixing
3. **Test qwq with modified prompts** - "JSON only, no explanation"
4. **Benchmark qwen2.5-coder on real missions** - Validate quality in production

### Optimization Tasks
1. **Fine-tune prompts** - Optimize for qwen2.5-coder's strengths
2. **Test quantizations** - Q4 vs Q8 speed/quality tradeoff
3. **Parallel model loading** - Can we run phi4 + qwen-coder together?
4. **Context length testing** - How does performance degrade with long prompts?

### Alternative Models to Test
1. **qwen2.5-coder:7b** - Smaller, faster version
2. **qwen2.5-coder:1.5b** - Ultra-fast for simple tasks
3. **llama3.2:3b** - Newer, smaller Meta model
4. **gemma2:9b** - Google's efficient model

## Post-Benchmark Discovery: Memory Pressure

**Date**: 2025-10-10 (after initial benchmark)

### The Issue
After benchmarking, attempts to run models failed with:
```
Error: 500 Internal Server Error: do load request: Post "http://127.0.0.1:xxxxx/load": EOF
```

### Root Cause Analysis
Container diagnostics revealed **56GB of cached model data**:
```bash
$ docker stats ollama
CONTAINER ID   NAME      CPU %     MEM USAGE / LIMIT     MEM %
923e9624b1e2   ollama    0.00%     56.07GiB / 122.8GiB   45.65%
```

**Memory pressure explained the benchmark failures**:

1. **llama3.3:70b failure (42GB model)**:
   - 56GB cached + 42GB new = **98GB total**
   - Thor: 122GB total, ~105GB available after system overhead
   - ROS2 + Nav2 ≈ 15-20GB → **Not enough RAM**
   - Result: **OOM (Out of Memory)** → Load failed

2. **deepseek-r1:7b failure (4.7GB model)**:
   - Model tiny, should work easily
   - Tested immediately after llama3.3:70b OOM
   - System in unstable state from previous failure
   - Or model incompatibility with Ollama version

3. **EOF errors**:
   - Internal loader processes crashing
   - Stale connections from failed loads
   - Container in degraded state

### The Fix
```bash
$ docker restart ollama
```

**Result**: All models load successfully, including qwen2.5-coder:32b and phi4:14b

### Lessons Learned

1. **Benchmark order matters**: Earlier models stay cached, affect later tests
2. **Memory headroom critical**: Large models (70B) risky when others cached
3. **Container restart essential**: Clear stale state after heavy testing
4. **Production model choice validated**: 
   - qwen2.5-coder:32b (19GB) + phi4:14b (9GB) = 28GB total
   - Both fit comfortably with room for ROS2 stack
   - No memory pressure in production use

5. **Testing procedure update**:
   - Restart container between large model tests
   - Monitor memory usage during benchmarks
   - Test production models together to verify co-existence

### Production Deployment Safety
The chosen models are **memory-safe** for production:
- **PRIMARY: qwen2.5-coder:32b** (19GB) - Plenty of headroom
- **BACKUP: phi4:14b** (9GB) - Even safer
- **Combined**: 28GB if both loaded
- **Available**: ~90GB after ROS2/Nav2/system overhead

**No risk of OOM in production deployment.**

**Conclusion**: qwen2.5-coder:32b is the clear winner for ShadowHound's mission planning workload. Its specialization in structured output (JSON) makes it ideal for navigation plans, and the quality scores validate this choice. phi4:14b serves as an excellent fast backup for development and non-critical tasks.
