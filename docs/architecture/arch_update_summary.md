# Architecture Update Summary

## Purpose
Preserve historical context while signaling that this page requires verification against the current workflow.

## Prerequisites
- Review the legacy notes below to understand original assumptions and instructions.
- Cross-check commands and links with the latest tooling before execution.

## Steps
1. Read through the legacy notes captured under **Legacy Notes** and flag outdated guidance.
2. Update or replace the content with validated procedures as time permits.
3. Record verification outcomes in the validation checklist and mark follow-up tasks in the backlog.

### Legacy Notes
**Date**: October 4, 2025  
**Version**: v0.1.0 → v0.2.0

## 🎯 What Happened

ShadowHound architecture has been **completely redesigned** to leverage the **DIMOS (Dimensional Framework)** for Unitree robots, eliminating the need to build robot infrastructure from scratch.

## 📊 Impact

### Code Reduction
- **Removed**: ~3 packages worth of infrastructure code (interfaces, robot, core skills)
- **Kept**: 3 packages for mission-specific implementations
- **Estimated savings**: 80% less code to write and maintain

### Time to Value
- **Before**: Months to build robot control, skills, agents, perception
- **After**: Days to integrate DIMOS and start implementing missions
- **Accelerated**: Can focus on mission logic immediately

### Capabilities Gained
From DIMOS out-of-the-box:
- ✅ Full robot control (`UnitreeGo2`, `UnitreeROSControl`)
- ✅ Skills framework (`AbstractRobotSkill`, `SkillLibrary`)
- ✅ Agent integration (`OpenAIAgent`, `PlanningAgent`)
- ✅ Perception (object detection, tracking, spatial memory)
- ✅ Path planning (VFH local, A* global)
- ✅ Web interface (FastAPI with video streaming)
- ✅ RxPY reactive streams

## 📝 Documentation Changes

### Updated Files
1. **docs/project.md** (641 lines)
   - New DIMOS-based architecture diagrams
   - Integration instructions
   - Custom skill templates
   - Updated implementation phases

2. **docs/dimos_integration.md** (NEW - 250+ lines)
   - Detailed integration plan
   - Week-by-week implementation guide
   - Code examples for each phase
   - Key DIMOS component reference

3. **docs/arch_update_summary.md** (THIS FILE)

### Files to Update Next
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - Update with DIMOS patterns
- `README.md` - Add DIMOS quick start
- Create `shadowhound.repos` - VCS dependencies

## 🏗️ New Architecture

### Layer Stack
```
ShadowHound Application (Launch files, configs)
        ↓
DIMOS Agents (OpenAIAgent, PlanningAgent)
        ↓
DIMOS Skills + ShadowHound Custom Skills
        ↓
DIMOS Robot (UnitreeGo2, UnitreeROSControl)
        ↓
Hardware (go2_ros2_sdk)
```

### Package Structure
**Removed**:
- ❌ shadowhound_interfaces
- ❌ shadowhound_robot  
- ❌ Core shadowhound_skills implementations

**Kept/Modified**:
- ✅ shadowhound_bringup (launch files for missions)
- ✅ shadowhound_skills (mission-specific skills only)
- ✅ shadowhound_mission_agent (high-level orchestration)

## 🔄 Updated Implementation Phases

### Phase 0: DIMOS Integration (CURRENT)
- Add DIMOS to workspace
- Verify integration
- Test basic robot control

### Phase 1: Custom Skills
- PatrolArea
- SearchForObject
- InvestigateAnomaly
- ReportFindings

### Phase 2: Hardware Testing
- Validate on real Go2
- Safety testing
- Performance tuning

### Phase 3: Mission Agent
- Natural language missions
- Multi-mission scheduling
- Error recovery

### Phase 4-6: Advanced Features
- Enhanced perception
- Deployment optimization
- Complex missions

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### What DIMOS Provides
1. **Robot Abstraction**: `UnitreeGo2` class with high-level methods
2. **Skills Framework**: Pydantic-based skill definitions with type validation
3. **Agent Integration**: Function calling with auto-generated tool definitions
4. **Reactive Streams**: RxPY for managing real-time sensor data
5. **Command Queue**: Safe management of multi-step actions
6. **Transform Management**: tf2-based localization
7. **Web Interface**: FastAPI with WebSocket video streaming

### What ShadowHound Adds
1. **Mission-specific skills**: Patrol, search, investigate patterns
2. **Mission planning**: Higher-level task decomposition
3. **Deployment configs**: Launch files for specific mission types
4. **Domain knowledge**: Security/patrol-specific behaviors

## 📚 References

- **DIMOS GitHub**: https://github.com/dimensionalOS/dimos-unitree
- **Project Context**: docs/project.md
- **Integration Plan**: docs/dimos_integration.md
- **Original Design**: docs/project.md.backup (v0.1.0)

## ✅ Verification

To verify this update is working:

```bash
# 1. Check docs are updated
ls -lh docs/project.md docs/dimos_integration.md

# 2. Verify architecture diagrams show DIMOS layers
grep -A 10 "Layer Overview" docs/project.md

# 3. Confirm package structure is simplified
grep -A 20 "Package Structure" docs/project.md

# 4. Review integration plan
less docs/dimos_integration.md
```

## 🚀 Next Actions

1. **Review** updated documentation with team
2. **Create** shadowhound.repos with DIMOS dependencies
3. **Test** DIMOS integration in devcontainer
4. **Begin** Phase 0 implementation (DIMOS integration)

_This architectural shift positions ShadowHound to deliver mission-critical capabilities faster by standing on the shoulders of the DIMOS framework._


## Validation
- [ ] Legacy guidance reviewed for accuracy and converted to the new workflow where applicable.
- [ ] Links updated to use vault-friendly wikilinks or confirmed for external references.
- [ ] Outstanding migration work captured as tasks in the backlog.
