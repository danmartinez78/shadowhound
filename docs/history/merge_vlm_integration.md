# Merge: VLM Integration into DIMOS Integration

## Purpose
Preserve historical context while signaling that this page requires verification against the current workflow.

## Prerequisites
- Review the legacy notes below to understand original assumptions and instructions.
- Cross-check commands and links with the latest tooling before execution.

## Steps
1. Read through the legacy notes captured under **Legacy Notes** and flag outdated guidance.
2. Update or replace the content with validated procedures as time permits.
3. Record verification outcomes in the validation checklist and mark follow-up tasks in the backlog.

### Legacy Notes
**Date**: October 7, 2025  
**Merge Commit**: `17a0542`  
**From**: `feature/vlm-integration`  
**Into**: `feature/dimos-integration`  
**Status**: ✅ Successfully merged and pushed

---

## Summary

Successfully merged VLM integration Phase 1 into the main DIMOS integration branch. The vision skills package is now part of the core ShadowHound system and ready for mission agent integration.

## Pre-Merge Steps

### 1. Rebased vlm-integration onto latest dimos-integration

```bash
git checkout feature/dimos-integration
git pull origin feature/dimos-integration
git checkout feature/vlm-integration
git rebase feature/dimos-integration
git push --force-with-lease origin feature/vlm-integration
```

**Result**: Clean linear history, no conflicts

### 2. Verification

- ✅ Build successful: `colcon build --packages-select shadowhound_skills`
- ✅ Tests passing: 4/4 vision skills tests
- ✅ No conflicts during rebase

## Merge Process

### Command

```bash
git checkout feature/dimos-integration
git merge feature/vlm-integration --no-ff -m "Merge feature/vlm-integration: Add vision skills..."
git push origin feature/dimos-integration
```

### Merge Strategy

- **Type**: Non-fast-forward merge (`--no-ff`)
- **Reason**: Preserve feature branch history for clarity
- **Conflicts**: None
- **Merge commit**: `17a0542`

- **No DIMOS required** (PIL/numpy only)
- Saves to `/tmp/shadowhound/images/` with timestamps
- Returns image path, size, timestamp metadata

#### 2. vision.describe_scene
- VLM scene understanding
- Uses DIMOS `query_single_frame()`
- Requires DIMOS + ALIBABA_API_KEY
- Returns structured description

#### 3. vision.locate_object
- Object detection with bounding boxes
- Uses DIMOS `get_bbox_from_qwen_frame()`
- Returns bbox [x1,y1,x2,y2], center, dimensions
- Size estimation included

#### 4. vision.detect_objects
- Detect all prominent objects in scene
- VLM query with JSON parsing
- Falls back to text parsing if JSON fails
- Returns object list with count

### Technical Architecture

```python
VisionSkillBase (base class)
├── __init__(image_dir, require_dimos)
├── _save_image(image, prefix) → Path
├── _numpy_to_pil(image) → Image.Image
│
├── SnapshotSkill (require_dimos=False)
├── DescribeSceneSkill (require_dimos=True)
├── LocateObjectSkill (require_dimos=True)
└── DetectObjectsSkill (require_dimos=True)

@dataclass
class SkillResult:
    success: bool
    data: Optional[Dict[str, Any]]
    error: Optional[str]
    telemetry: Optional[Dict[str, Any]]
```

## Commits Merged

```
346254d docs: Document DIMOS vision capabilities discovery
43fe114 feat(skills): implement vision skills package with DIMOS Qwen VLM integration

## Post-Merge Verification

### Build Test
```bash
$ colcon build --packages-select shadowhound_skills
Starting >>> shadowhound_skills
Finished <<< shadowhound_skills [34.4s]
Summary: 1 package finished [56.6s]
✅ BUILD SUCCESS
```

### Test Results
```bash
$ python3 src/shadowhound_skills/test/test_vision.py

Available skills: ['vision.snapshot', 'vision.describe_scene', 
                   'vision.locate_object', 'vision.detect_objects']

✅ PASS: Snapshot           (tested with actual image save)
✅ PASS: Describe Scene     (gracefully skipped without API key)
✅ PASS: Locate Object      (gracefully skipped without API key)
✅ PASS: Detect Objects     (gracefully skipped without API key)

Results: 4/4 tests passed
🎉 All tests passed!
```

### Integration Check
- ✅ Package imports work: `from shadowhound_skills.vision import *`
- ✅ Skills registry accessible: `VISION_SKILLS` dict
- ✅ Get skill function works: `get_skill('vision.snapshot')`
- ✅ Image saving verified: `/tmp/shadowhound/images/snapshot_*.jpg`
